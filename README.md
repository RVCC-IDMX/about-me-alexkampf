##DESCRIPTION##
This is my About Me for my web dev 1 class at RVCC, made during the Fall of 2021. It was made over the course of the semester, as we went over more and more tools in HTML and CSS, using guidelines setout by Professor Caruso. Each section is outlined below, as well as general design choices.

##GENERAL##
From the beginning I had a specific theme in mind when designing the general feel. I had a completely different color scheme at first, but I decided to change it to cooler colors that are easier on the eye, and I'm very happy with the result. here are the hex and RGBA values used:

#2e3047
#3bba9c
#6f63ad
59,186,156,0.73
59,186,156,1

##LOGO##
In this section I actually learned a lot, specifically about vector art. I struggled a lot exporting into the correct format, but after improving my understanding of vector art, I was able to get a logo I was happy with.

##NAVBAR##
The creation process of the navbar taught me a lot about using flexbox and links. I had previously had a lot of trouble getting both flex and grid to work the ways I needed it to, and working on this helped.

##HERO##
The hero was one of the very first things I worked on, and hasnt gone through many changes at all compared to other sections. It served as my intro to both HTML and CSS, and helped me to understand the basics.

##PHOTO GALLERY##
The Photo Gallery served as a challenge, mainly because it was the first section to change drastically from a media query. I had to do a lot of tweaking of both the Gallery itself and media query in order to get it to work. This is probably the section I'm least happy with, as the images aren't totally centered and I'm not a fan of the visible lines between them.

##VIDEO##
This section gave me a lot of trouble, and a majority of the code is taken from a video by Dani Krossing, which can be found both in the code and in the sources section of this README.

##BLOG##
The Blog was very fun and interesting to research and write. I'm very happy with how the animation turned out, which was tweaked from the codepen listed in the sources. I originally wanted to also get the dropcap's text to flicker as well, but I unfortunately couldn't get it to work.

##CONTACT##
The styling of the contact form probably took the most time out of any section, as having another bordered section within an already bordered section proved to be difficult to color in a way I was happy with. Building this section taught me a lot about checkboxes and buttons, and was actually quite useful when I went back to create the mobile version's navbar.
