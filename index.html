                <p> Hi, I'm Alex!</p>
                <p>I'm an IT student, wrapping up my time at RVCC! Covid has made times tough, but luckily I came out
                    the other end, and am ready to continue my education and get my degree. I've been passionate about
                    computers since a young age, when I first saw my dad attempting to fix the family computer. Since
                    then Ive been really into gaming, programming, PC building, and more. I took last year off due to
                    covid, working a retail job and doing a web development internship in the mean time. I was actually
                    pretty bad at web development, but now that I've taken a course in it, I'm a lot more confident in
                    my skills.</p>

            </ul>

            <p> I have a lot of hobbies, but PC Gaming is probably my biggest. In my spare time I can more than likely
                be found sitting at my desk playing something online with my friends. My favorite games are Fallout: New
                Vegas, the Dark Souls trilogy, the Hotline Miami games, Apex Legends, Stardew Valley, and Hunt:
                Showdown.</p>
            <p> I've been drawing from a young age, and for a while I actually planned on studying art, but ended up
                deciding I'd rather have it as a hobby. Recently I got an art tablet and have been learning how to draw
                digitally.</p>
            <p>Recently I've gotten really into model building; Gunpla in particular.Gunpla are model kits specifically
                modeled after mechs from the popular anime Gundam. I've never actually watched the show, but I think the
                models are really fun to build.</p>
            <p>In my friend group I've kind of become known as the go to guy for help with pc building. Ive built three
                PCs for my friends, and am currently helping one of them choose parts for an upgrade.</p>

            <h2>Blog: CSS Animation</h2>

            <div>
                <p>CSS animation is a really useful tool to set a website apart from other websites. A lot of animation
                    on the web nowadays uses JavaScript, because it can handle more complex animations precisely. But, a
                    lot of really cool animations can be done solely using CSS too!</p>

                <p>Many developers use CSS animations for more simple animations, like transitions, animated loading
                    icons, or toggling the state of different UI elements. Things like color changes, element
                    transformation, element scaling, and element rotation are the simplest animations, and serve as the
                    building blocks for the more complex ones that CSS is capable of making. </p>

                <p>There are ten properties specifically used for animation in CSS. They are: @keyframes, animation,
                    animation-delay, animation-direction, animation-duration, animation-fill-mode,
                    animation-iteration-count, animation-name, animation-play-state, and animation-timing-function. It’s
                    very possible not to use a lot of these in an animation, but they all have their uses.</p>

                <p>Probably the most important amongst them is the @keyframes property, as it’s where developers specify
                    exactly what the animation does. All the other properties are used for affecting the whole
                    animation, while @keyframes specifies the changes that happen over the course of the animation. For
                    example, animation-duration changes the entire length of the animation, while in @keyframes the
                    length of the different states of the animation can be changed. More than likely, a majority of the
                    code used to make an animation will be in the @keyframes property. The animation you see making the
                    border of this blog flicker contain almost 40 lines of code in its @keyframes property alone.</p>

                <p>Probably the most used element of @keyframes is percent. Percent allows you to decide exactly when a
                    change in style happens, using percentages. The percentage is of the total amount of time allotted
                    to the animation using the animation-duration property. So, for example, if the duration was set as
                    two seconds, and then in the @keyframe the style changes fifty percent through, the style would
                    change one second after the start of the animation. Using percent, developers can shift the style as
                    many times as they want.</p>

                <p>The other animation properties serve to affect the entire animation as a whole. For instance,
                    animation-delay allows developers to choose to delay the start of the animation, stopping it from
                    instantly starting upon the opening of the web page. One of the more important properties that
                    doesn’t actively affect the animation is the animation-name property. It serves as a link between
                    the other properties and the @keyframe property, allowing the @keyframe to actually affect the
                    animation. In other words, if the name isn’t set in both the element the animation is being applied
                    to and the @keyframe, nothing will happen. Another extremely useful property is the animation
                    property, which serves as a shorthand for using most of the other properties. It’s very handy for
                    saving space in the code itself, and keeping everything readable.</p>

                <p>With these building blocks, web developers are able to create great websites. For more complex
                    animations, many use JavaScript. Many developers however make amazing and complex animations, solely
                    using CSS. Codepen.io is a great place to go for examples of great CSS animations.</p>
