            <h2> A Passage From At the Mountains of Maddness, by H.P. Lovecraft, 1936</h2>

            <div>
                <p>At bottom of torso, rough but dissimilarly functioning counterparts of head arrangements exist.
                    Bulbous light-gray pseudo-neck, without gill suggestions, holds greenish five-pointed starfish
                    arrangement. Tough, muscular arms four feet long and tapering from seven inches diameter at base to
                    about two and five-tenths at point. To each point is attached small end of a greenish five-veined
                    membranous triangle eight inches long and six wide at farther end. This is the paddle, fin, or
                    pseudofoot which has made prints in rocks from a thousand million to fifty or sixty million years
                    old. From inner angles of starfish-arrangement project two-foot reddish tubes tapering from three
                    inches diameter at base to one at tip. Orifices at tips. All these parts infinitely tough and
                    leathery, but extremely flexible. Four-foot arms with paddles undoubtedly used for locomotion of
                    some sort, marine or otherwise. When moved, display suggestions of exaggerated muscularity. As
                    found, all these projections tightly folded over pseudoneck and end of torso, corresponding to
                    projections at other end.</p>

                <p>Cannot yet assign positively to animal or vegetable kingdom, but odds now favor animal. Probably
                    represents incredibly advanced evolution of radiata without loss of certain primitive features.
                    Echinoderm resemblances unmistakable despite local contradictory evidences. Wing structure puzzles
                    in view of probable marine habitat, but may have use in water navigation. Symmetry is curiously
                    vegetablelike, suggesting vegetable's essential up-and-down structure rather than animal's
                    fore-and-aft structure. Fabulously early date of evolution, preceding even simplest Archaean
                    protozoa hitherto known, baffles all conjecture as to origin.</p>

                <p>Complete specimens have such uncanny resemblance to certain creatures of primal myth that suggestion
                    of ancient existence outside antarctic becomes inevitable. Dyer and Pabodie have read Necronomicon
                    and seen Clark Ashton Smith's nightmare paintings based on text, and will understand when I speak of
                    Elder Things supposed to have created all earth life as jest or mistake. Students have always
                    thought conception formed from morbid imaginative treatment of very ancient tropical radiata. Also
                    like prehistoric folklore things Wilmarth has spoken of—Cthulhu cult appendages, etc.</p>

                <p>Vast field of study opened. Deposits probably of late Cretaceous or early Eocene period, judging
                    from associated specimens. Massive stalagmites deposited above them. Hard work hewing out, but
                    toughness prevented damage. State of preservation miraculous, evidently owing to limestone action.
                    No more found so far, but will resume search later. Job now to get fourteen huge specimens to camp
                    without dogs, which bark furiously and can't be trusted near them. With nine men—three left to guard
                    the dogs—we ought to manage the three sledges fairly well, though wind is bad. Must establish plane
                    communication with McMurdo Sound and begin shipping material. But I've got to dissect one of these
                    things before we take any rest. Wish I had a real laboratory here. Dyer better kick himself for
                    having tried to stop my westward trip. First the world's greatest mountains, and then this. If this
                    last isn't the high spot of the expedition, I don't know what is. We're made scientifically.
                    Congrats, Pabodie, on the drill that opened up the cave. Now will Arkham please repeat description?"
                </p>

                <p>The sensations of Pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost beyond description, nor
                    were our companions much behind us in enthusiasm. McTighe, who had hastily translated a few high
                    spots as they came from the droning receiving set, wrote out the entire message from his shorthand
                    version as soon as Lake's operator signed off. All appreciated the epoch-making significance of the
                    discovery, and I sent Lake congratulations as soon as the Arkham's operator had repeated back the
                    descriptive parts as requested; and my example was followed by Sherman from his station at the
                    McMurdo Sound supply cache, as well as by Captain Douglas of the Arkham. Later, as head of the
                    expedition, I added some remarks to be relayed through the Arkham to the outside world. Of course,
                    rest was an absurd thought amidst this excitement; and my only wish was to get to Lake's camp as
                    quickly as I could. It disappointed me when he sent word that a rising mountain gale made early
                    aerial travel impossible.</p>

                <p>But within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment. Lake, sending more
                    messages, told of the completely successful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the
                    camp. It had been a hard pull, for the things were surprisingly heavy; but nine men had accomplished
                    it very neatly. Now some of the party were hurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from
                    the camp, to which the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding. The specimens were
                    laid out on the hard snow near the camp, save for one on which Lake was making crude attempts at
                    dissection.</p>
